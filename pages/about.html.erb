<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">About Where To Ski</h2>

<p>
  Finding the best skiing conditions shouldn't be a guessing game. Where To Ski
  brings together real-time snow forecasts from ski resorts around the world in
  one simple, fast-loading site.
</p>

<h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Our Story</h3>

<p>
  It started with a simple decision on March 6th, 2022. While heading to Winter
  Park, Colorado, we checked the forecasts and noticed better conditions at
  Steamboat Springs. That spontaneous detour turned into an excellent day on the
  slopes.
</p>

<p>
  That experience sparked an idea: what if choosing where to ski could always be
  this informed? Where To Ski was born from that practical need—a tool to help
  skiers and snowboarders quickly find the best conditions without hunting
  across multiple websites.
